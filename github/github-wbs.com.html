    <p>**Five Nights at King Von’s** is a terrifying survival horror game where stealth and strategy are your only hope. Locked inside the abandoned **O’Block Party Venue**, you must survive five relentless nights while being hunted by the ghost of **King Von**.  

        With no flashlight to guide you, you’ll have to rely on your **hearing and instincts** to navigate the pitch-black hallways. Every creak of the floor, every breath you take could be the difference between survival and getting caught. **Hiding spots are limited**, and once Von senses your presence, you’ll need to **run and evade him**—but be careful, because **your stamina won’t last forever**.  
        
        Each night, the tension builds as Von’s hunting skills become sharper, forcing you to adapt or face a brutal end. Can you survive all five nights, or will you become just another lost soul in the **O’Block nightmare**?</p>
